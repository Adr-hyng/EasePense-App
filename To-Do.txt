3. Filter based on category.

2. Details:
* IF item.quantity in cart is equal or above to stock value, then disable the Feature Product item by disabling the add to cart button with grey color as indicator.
* IF item.quantity in cart is equal or above to stock value, then disable the Cartitem's add button by displaying it in grey background, so you can only decrement the quantity, not increment.
